<!-- # HelloRust
This repository contains small code snippets and programs that I created while learning Rust. I plan to write a blog post detailing my learning journey and methods, which will document the challenges I faced.

The repository features simple problems that I defined with the help of ChatGPT. Initially, my code was scattered across various folders and somewhat disorganized. To streamline things, Iâ€™ve consolidated everything into a Rust crate for easier management and replication.

Here's the list of problems that are very simple and be completed within 10-12 hours of learning Rust (Although it took me some weeksðŸ˜…). Hope it helps the newbie! This isn't like [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), which is another awesome thing, but this is just a personal list.

### Regarding the Problems
**Basic Concepts**: The initial problems are designed to cover fundamental Rust concepts and basic programming exercises, focusing on core skills like function definition, control flow, and simple I/O operations.

**Advanced Topics**: Later levels of the exercises, particularly from Level 6 onwards, explore more advanced Rust features.

>Currently the Tests are not written. So you have to test the function individually. -->

# HelloRust

Welcome to **HelloRust**! This repository contains a collection of small code snippets and programs created during my journey of learning Rust. My goal is to document and share my learning experience, including the challenges I encountered along the way.

## Purpose

This repository is designed to provide a set of simple problems that are intended to be completed within 10-12 hours of learning Rust. While it took me several weeks to work through these problems ðŸ˜…, I hope this collection will be helpful for other newbies to Rust.

## Repository Structure

Originally, my code was scattered across various folders, which made it challenging to manage. To streamline things, I've consolidated all code into a single Rust crate. This organization should make it easier to manage and replicate.

There's also a seperate set of problems on Macros & Traits, that I asked ChatGPT to provide while solving the problems in the 10th Level. I didn't understand macros and traits until that point. So I had decided to double down and solve more problems regarding that.

There should be a good list of around 20 problems there, which I have solved in macros.rs & traits.rs. Do give the problems a try yourself, before looking at my odd looking solutions ðŸ˜….

## Problems Overview

### Basic Concepts

The initial set of problems focuses on fundamental Rust concepts and basic programming exercises. Topics covered:

- Function definition
- Control flow
- Simple I/O operations

### Advanced Topics

From Level 6 onwards, the problems delve into more advanced Rust features. Topics covered:

- Advanced data structures
- Error handling
- Concurrency
- Macros & Traits

## Testing

Currently, there are no automated tests written for these problems. You will need to test each function individually to ensure it works as expected.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HelloRust.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Crate Directory**:
   ```sh
   cd HelloRust
   ```

3. **Build and Run**:
   To build and run the examples, use:
   ```sh
   cargo build
   cargo run
   ```

4. **Test Functions Individually**: Modify and run each problem to test its functionality.

## Acknowledgements

This repository was inspired by various resources, including the [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises. While this is a personal list of problems, I highly recommend checking out Rustlings for a more structured learning path.
