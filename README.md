# HelloRust
This repository contains small code snippets and programs that I created while learning Rust. I plan to write a blog post detailing my learning journey and methods, which will document the challenges I faced.

The repository features simple problems that I defined with the help of ChatGPT. Initially, my code was scattered across various folders and somewhat disorganized. To streamline things, Iâ€™ve consolidated everything into a Rust crate for easier management and replication.

Here's the list of problems that are very simple and be completed within 5-6 hours of learning Rust (Although it took me some daysðŸ˜…). Hope it helps the newbie!
