# HelloRust
This repository contains small code snippets and programs that I created while learning Rust. I plan to write a blog post detailing my learning journey and methods, which will document the challenges I faced.

The repository features simple problems that I defined with the help of ChatGPT. Initially, my code was scattered across various folders and somewhat disorganized. To streamline things, Iâ€™ve consolidated everything into a Rust crate for easier management and replication.

Here's the list of problems that are very simple and be completed within 10-12 hours of learning Rust (Although it took me some weeksðŸ˜…). Hope it helps the newbie! This isn't like [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), which is another awesome thing, but this is just a personal list.

### Regarding the Problems
**Basic Concepts**: The initial problems are designed to cover fundamental Rust concepts and basic programming exercises, focusing on core skills like function definition, control flow, and simple I/O operations.

**Advanced Topics**: Later levels of the exercises, particularly from Level 6 onwards, explore more advanced Rust features.

>Currently the Tests are not written. So you have to test the function individually.
